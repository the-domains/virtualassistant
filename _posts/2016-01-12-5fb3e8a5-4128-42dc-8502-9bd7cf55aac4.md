# RATES:

I offer competitive rates for my services.

My services can help Companies or individuals improve their image and professionalism.

**Short quick proof reads** for items like letters, e-mails, packaging and instruction leaflets can be paid for in advance in bulk.

10 items: $15\.

20 items: $25

30 items: $35

40 items: $45

50 items: $55

For people using my proof reading service for the first time, I am happy to correct one short document for **free**.

**Longer documents or projects like website content** can be charged on an hourly rate of $10.00\. I can give an estimated quote or costing once I have seen the length of the document that the work is needed for. A 10% deposit will be needed to commence the work, the balance due on completion.
