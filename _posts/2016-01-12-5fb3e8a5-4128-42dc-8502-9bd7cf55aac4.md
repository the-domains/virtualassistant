I offer competitive rates for my services because I am based at home, and in Jordan. My services can help non Western Companies or individuals improve their image and professionalism when communicating with Western Companies or individuals without needing to employ an expensive ex-pat on location.

**Short quick proof reads** for items like letters, e-mails, packaging and instruction leaflets can be paid for in advance in bulk. 

10 items: $15\. 

20 items: $25

30 items: $35

40 items: $45 

50 items: $55 

For people using my proof reading service for the first time, I am happy to correct one short document for **free**.

**Longer documents or projects like website content** can be charged on an hourly rate of $10.00\. I can give an estimated quote or costing once I have seen the length of the document that the work is needed for. A 10% deposit will be needed to commence the work, the balance due on completion.
