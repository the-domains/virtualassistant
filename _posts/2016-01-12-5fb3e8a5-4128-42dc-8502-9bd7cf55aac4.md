I can offer competitive rates for my services because I am based at home, and in Jordan. My services can help non Western Companies or individuals improve their image and professionalism when communicating with Western Companies or individuals without needing to employ an expensive ex-pat on location.

Short quick proof reads for items like letters, e-mails, packaging and instruction leaflets can be paid for in advance in bulk - for example 10, 20, 30, 40 or 50 items. 

Longer documents or projects like website content would be charged on an hourly rate of $10.00\. I would give an estimated quote or costing once I have seen the length of the document that the work is needed for, a 10% deposit will be needed then I can commence the work, the balance due on completion.
