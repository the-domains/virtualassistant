## Who can use my Services?

* Production Companies - I can check instruction leaflets, product packaging and slogans, other company documents which are written in English.
* Small Businesses or Companies, startups etc - those companies wanting to keep the number of individuals they employ to a minimum but need to write business communication, documents, e-mails etc in English when English is their second language.
* Personal Assistants - individuals working in the Middle East, Asia who speak English as a second language and have to do a lot of written work in English.
* Individuals - people from the Middle East, Asia who have a temporary or long term need to write a document in English but need help to write in good English. I can help with checking immigration applications (for quality of language not content), job application letters, C.V's, other professional e-mails, letters or documents.
