## Who am I?

A British University Graduate (MA) with 5 years experience working for a U.K financial adviser as a personal assistant (P.A). 

Plus 6 years experience as the administrator for a small family niche tour business in Jordan.

I am currently located in Jordan with my family not too far from Aqaba. 

I am offering my services and skills virtually to those who may benefit from them.
