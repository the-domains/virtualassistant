# WHO AM I?

A British University Graduate (MA) with 5 years experience working as a personal assistant (P.A) for a successful U.K financial adviser.

Six years experience as the administrator for a small family niche tour business in Jordan. 

I am currently located in Jordan with my family not too far from Aqaba. 

I am offering my services and skills virtually to those who may benefit from them.
