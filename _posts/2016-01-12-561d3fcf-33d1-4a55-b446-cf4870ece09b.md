# WHO AM I?

A British University Graduate (MA).

Five years experience working as a personal assistant (P.A) for a successful U.K financial adviser.

Six years experience as the administrator for a small niche tour business in Jordan.

I am currently located in Jordan with my husband and children.

I am offering my services and skills virtually to those who may benefit from them.
