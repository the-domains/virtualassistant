# CONTACT:

**e-mail: thevirtualassistanteast@outlook.com**

Files can be received by e-mail for working on, and will be sent back by e-mail. I also have dropbox and can receive, work on and share files this way.

## Payment:

I can currently accept payment via PAYPAL. Invoices will be sent from my paypal account via e-mail and can then be securely paid to me with a paypal account or the usual VISA/ Mastercards etc.

I have given my rates with USD but I can also give rates in other currencies as long as the currency is accepted by Paypal.
