* **Proof reading:** I can quickly check, correct and improve written English for anything from letters, to e-mails, to instruction leaflets, to packaging, to longer more technical business documents, or website content. Sentence structure, wording, spelling, punctuation, grammar can all be improved. In short if you have written content you want to be professional, and of good quality (but perhaps your own written English is not equivalent to a native English writer) then I can help you. 
* **Writing: **Given appropriate information and a "brief" I can write text for letters, websites, blogs, e-mails and other professional documents.
